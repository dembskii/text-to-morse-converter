        <p class="text-justify"><strong>Morse code</strong> is a method used in telecommunication to encode text characters as standardized sequences of two different signal durations, called dots and dashes, or dits and dahs. Morse code is named after <strong>Samuel Morse</strong> , one of the inventors of the telegraph. <br> <br><strong>International Morse Code</strong> encodes the 26 basic Latin letters a through z, one accented Latin letter (Ã©), the Arabic numerals, and a small set of punctuation and procedural signals (prosigns). There is no distinction between upper and lower case letters. Each Morse code symbol is formed by a sequence of dits and dahs. The dit duration is the basic unit of time measurement in Morse code transmission. The duration of a dah is three times the duration of a dit. Each dit or dah within an encoded character is followed by a period of signal absence, called a space, equal to the dit duration. The letters of a word are separated by a space of duration equal to three dits, and words are separated by a space equal to seven dits. <br><a class="a-source" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[source]</a>
